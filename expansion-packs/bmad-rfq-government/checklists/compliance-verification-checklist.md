# Compliance Verification Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist ensures that the proposal fully addresses all RFQ requirements and is structured for maximum compliance. It helps proposal teams verify that every requirement is properly traced, addressed, and evidenced in the proposal.

## Instructions

1. Complete this checklist before each review gate (Pink, Red, Gold)
2. Mark each item as either:
   - ✅ Compliant (fully meets requirement)
   - ❌ Non-compliant (fails to meet requirement)
   - ⚠️ Partially Compliant (needs improvement)
3. For any non-compliant or partially compliant items, note specific actions needed
4. Address all issues before proceeding to next review gate
