# Pricing Compliance Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist ensures that pricing volumes meet all RFQ requirements, demonstrate cost realism, and present a competitive yet profitable pricing strategy. It helps pricing teams verify that labor categories, rates, and assumptions are properly documented and justified.

## Instructions

1. Complete this checklist before finalizing the pricing volume
2. Mark each item as either:
   - ✅ Compliant (meets requirements)
   - ❌ Non-compliant (fails to meet requirements)
   - ⚠️ Partially Compliant (needs improvement)
3. For any non-compliant or partially compliant items, note specific actions needed
4. Address all issues before finalizing the pricing volume
