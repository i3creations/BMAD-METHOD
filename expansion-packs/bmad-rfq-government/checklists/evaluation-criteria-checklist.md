# Evaluation Criteria Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist helps proposal teams simulate the government evaluation process by systematically reviewing proposal content against Section M evaluation criteria. It enables teams to identify strengths, weaknesses, and compliance issues before submission, increasing the likelihood of favorable evaluation scores.

## Instructions

1. Complete this checklist during review simulation (Pink, Red, or Gold Team)
2. Mark each item using the appropriate adjectival rating:
   - ⭐⭐⭐ Outstanding (exceeds requirements, significant strengths)
   - ⭐⭐ Good (meets requirements, some strengths)
   - ⭐ Acceptable (meets minimum requirements)
   - ⚠️ Marginal (deficiencies that may be correctable)
   - ❌ Unacceptable (significant deficiencies)
3. Document specific strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations
4. Address all issues before proceeding to next review gate
