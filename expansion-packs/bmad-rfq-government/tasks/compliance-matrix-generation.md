# Compliance Matrix Generation Task

## Purpose

- Extract and organize all requirements from RFQ documents
- Create a comprehensive compliance matrix that ensures complete coverage
- Map requirements to proposal sections for traceability
- Establish the foundation for compliant proposal development
- Reduce risk of non-compliance disqualification

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New RFQ Compliance Matrix Creation

1. **Requirement Extraction**: Identify all requirements from imported RFQ documents
2. **Matrix Structure**: Organize requirements in a structured compliance matrix
3. **Response Mapping**: Map requirements to proposal sections and owners
4. **Validation**: Verify complete requirement coverage

### Scenario 2: Compliance Matrix Update

1. **Amendment Analysis**: Process changes from RFQ amendments
2. **Requirement Updates**: Modify affected requirements in the matrix
3. **Coverage Verification**: Ensure all new requirements are addressed
4. **Impact Assessment**: Identify impacts to proposal sections and content

## Task Instructions

### 1. Requirement Extraction Process

**Extraction Methodology**:

1. **Automated Identification**:
   - Scan for requirement indicators ("shall," "must," "will," etc.)
   - Identify numbered requirements and bullet points
   - Extract requirements with context and reference information

2. **Requirement Classification**:
   - Categorize by type (technical, management, past performance, etc.)
   - Identify mandatory vs. optional requirements
   - Tag with priority levels (critical, important, standard)

3. **Reference Preservation**:
   - Maintain source document references (section, page, paragraph)
   - Link to original text in RFQ documents
   - Preserve context for accurate interpretation

4. **Requirement Atomization**:
   - Break compound requirements into discrete items
   - Ensure each requirement addresses a single obligation
   - Assign unique requirement IDs (R-001, R-002, etc.)

### 2. Compliance Matrix Structure

**Matrix Components**:

1. **Core Matrix Fields**:
   - Requirement ID (unique identifier)
   - Requirement text (verbatim from RFQ)
   - Source reference (document, section, page)
   - Proposal section mapping
   - Owner assignment
   - Status tracking
   - Evidence/proof points

2. **Matrix Organization**:
   - Group by RFQ section (L.1, L.2, M.1, etc.)
   - Alternate organization by proposal volume/section
   - Hierarchical structure for nested requirements
   - Clear visual distinction between requirement types

3. **Status Tracking System**:
   - Not started
   - In progress
   - Draft complete
   - Reviewed
   - Final
   - Gap/issue identified

### 3. Strategic Compliance Planning

**Strategic Approach**:

1. **Requirement Analysis**:
   - Identify key discriminators and evaluation drivers
   - Assess complexity and effort required
   - Determine dependencies between requirements
   - Identify potential compliance challenges

2. **Response Strategy Development**:
   - Recommend optimal proposal organization
   - Suggest strategic grouping of requirements
   - Identify opportunities for emphasis and differentiation
   - Plan for addressing complex or unusual requirements

3. **Resource Allocation Planning**:
   - Assign SMEs based on requirement expertise
   - Balance workload across team members
   - Prioritize critical requirements
   - Establish realistic timelines

### 4. Compliance Validation

**Validation Process**:

1. **Completeness Check**:
   - Verify all requirements are captured
   - Confirm no duplications or omissions
   - Validate requirement atomization
   - Ensure proper cross-referencing

2. **Mapping Verification**:
   - Confirm all requirements map to proposal sections
   - Validate owner assignments
   - Check for gaps in coverage
   - Verify alignment with evaluation criteria

3. **Quality Control**:
   - Review requirement interpretation accuracy
   - Validate classification and prioritization
   - Check for consistency in formatting and structure
   - Ensure traceability throughout the matrix

## Best Practices

- **Complete Coverage**: Ensure every requirement is captured, no matter how minor
- **Atomic Requirements**: Break compound requirements into discrete, trackable items
- **Verbatim Extraction**: Use exact requirement language from the RFQ
- **Clear Ownership**: Assign specific owners to each requirement
- **Strategic Organization**: Organize requirements to facilitate efficient response development
- **Regular Updates**: Maintain the matrix as a living document throughout proposal development
- **Multiple Validations**: Conduct independent reviews to verify completeness
- **Visual Indicators**: Use color coding or icons to highlight status and priority

## Integration Points

- **RFQ Document Import**: Builds on imported and organized RFQ documents
- **Win Theme Development**: Informs strategic emphasis in compliance approach
- **Content Generation**: Drives section-specific content requirements
- **Review Simulation**: Provides foundation for compliance verification
- **Submission Checklist**: Ensures all requirements are addressed before submission
