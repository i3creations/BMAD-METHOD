# RFQ Document Import Task

## Purpose

- Enable efficient import and organization of RFQ documents into the system
- Prepare RFQ documents for AI-assisted analysis and processing
- Extract key metadata to facilitate proposal planning
- Establish the foundation for requirement extraction and compliance tracking

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New RFQ Response Project

1. **Document Collection**: Gather all RFQ documents (main RFQ, attachments, amendments)
2. **Import Process**: Upload documents into the system with proper organization
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Automatically identify key RFQ information
4. **Project Setup**: Establish folder structure and access permissions

### Scenario 2: RFQ Amendment Processing

1. **Amendment Import**: Add new amendment documents to existing project
2. **Diff Analysis**: Identify changes between original RFQ and amendments
3. **Requirement Updates**: Update affected requirements in compliance matrix
4. **Timeline Adjustments**: Modify project schedule based on amendment changes

## Task Instructions

### 1. Document Import and Organization

**Import Process**:

1. **Select Document Source**:
   - Upload from local files
   - Import from email attachments
   - Connect to procurement portal (SAM.gov, eBuy, etc.)

2. **Document Classification**:
   - Identify document type (RFQ main document, SOW, attachments, forms)
   - Tag with appropriate metadata (agency, RFQ number, date)
   - Validate document completeness

3. **Folder Structure Creation**:
   - Create standardized folder hierarchy
   - Organize documents by type and section
   - Implement version control for amendments

### 2. Metadata Extraction

**Key Information to Extract**:

1. **RFQ Identification**:
   - Agency name and contact information
   - RFQ/RFP number and title
   - NAICS code(s) and set-aside type

2. **Timeline Information**:
   - Response due date and time
   - Question submission deadline
   - Estimated award date
   - Period of performance

3. **Contract Details**:
   - Estimated contract value
   - Contract type (FFP, T&M, etc.)
   - Contract duration
   - Option periods

### 3. Initial RFQ Analysis

**Analysis Components**:

1. **Document Structure Analysis**:
   - Identify key sections (L, M, SOW/PWS)
   - Map document organization
   - Locate evaluation criteria

2. **Complexity Assessment**:
   - Estimate page count for response
   - Identify specialized requirements
   - Determine technical complexity level
   - Assess submission format requirements

3. **Timeline Planning**:
   - Calculate available response time
   - Identify critical milestones
   - Establish internal deadlines
   - Create proposal schedule

### 4. Project Setup Completion

**Final Setup Steps**:

1. **Team Assignment**:
   - Identify required roles (technical SMEs, pricing, etc.)
   - Assign responsibilities
   - Set up access permissions

2. **Kickoff Preparation**:
   - Generate RFQ summary for team review
   - Prepare initial questions for clarification
   - Identify potential win themes
   - Outline proposal approach

3. **Next Steps Guidance**:
   - Recommend immediate actions
   - Prioritize requirement extraction
   - Suggest compliance matrix structure
   - Outline content development approach

## Best Practices

- **Complete Import**: Ensure all RFQ documents are imported, including attachments and referenced materials
- **Thorough Metadata**: Extract all available metadata to facilitate search and organization
- **Consistent Structure**: Maintain standardized folder organization across all RFQ projects
