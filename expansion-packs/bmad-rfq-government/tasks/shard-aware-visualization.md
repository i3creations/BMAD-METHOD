   - Collect requirement coverage data across shards
   - Aggregate evaluation findings with shard references

2. **Heat Map Design**:
   - Create matrix layout with shards on one axis, themes/requirements on another
   - Develop color intensity scale for coverage strength
   - Implement filtering capabilities by theme/requirement type
   - Design interactive elements for drill-down analysis

3. **Implementation Techniques**:
   - Generate color-coded visualization showing theme density
   - Include numerical metrics for precise measurement
   - Provide comparison views between different themes
   - Enable toggle between absolute and relative measurement scales

4. **Gap Analysis Features**:
   - Automatically highlight areas with insufficient theme coverage
   - Calculate theme balance metrics across proposal
   - Compare theme coverage to evaluation criteria importance
   - Recommend specific areas for theme enhancement

### 2. Sharded Compliance Matrix Development

**Matrix Creation Process**:

1. **Compliance Data Integration**:
   - Map requirements from compliance matrix to content shards
   - Track requirement implementation status across shards
   - Monitor cross-references between related requirements
   - Link evaluation findings to specific requirements

2. **Matrix Design**:

   - Develop shard-aware filtering and navigation controls
   - Implement status indicators for each requirement
   - Design cross-reference visualization components

3. **Implementation Features**:
   - Generate interactive compliance matrix spanning all shards
   - Include status tracking (complete, partial, missing)
   - Provide direct links to relevant content shards
   - Enable filtering by status, section, or criticality

4. **Impact Analysis Tools**:
   - Visualize how requirement changes affect multiple shards
   - Show dependencies between requirements across shards
   - Calculate compliance completion percentages
   - Predict effort required for compliance gaps

### 3. Shard Navigation Tools Development
