# Government Evaluation Criteria Reference Guide

## Overview

This reference guide provides comprehensive information on common government evaluation criteria used in RFQs across various agencies. Understanding these criteria is essential for developing targeted, compliant proposals that effectively address evaluator expectations and maximize evaluation scores.

## General Evaluation Approaches

### Best Value Continuum

Government agencies use various approaches along the "best value continuum":

1. **Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA)**
   - Award goes to lowest priced offer that meets minimum technical requirements
   - All technical factors are pass/fail
   - No trade-offs between price and non-price factors
   - Used for well-defined requirements with minimal risk
   - Common in commodity purchases and standardized services

2. **Best Value Trade-off**
   - Allows trade-offs between price and non-price factors
   - Non-price factors may be significantly more important than price
   - Provides flexibility to select higher-priced, superior technical solutions
   - Used for complex requirements or where quality differences matter
   - Requires documented trade-off rationale

3. **Performance-Price Trade-off (Fixed Price â€“ Technical Trade-off)**
   - Hybrid approach: technical proposals evaluated, then price considered
   - Award goes to technically superior offer unless price premium is not justified
   - Limited documentation of trade-off rationale required
   - Used when technical superiority has value, but price remains important

### Adjectival Rating Scales

Common rating scales used by government evaluators:

1. **Five-Level Scale**
   - **Outstanding**: Exceptional approach with significant strengths and no weaknesses
   - **Good**: Quality approach with strengths outweighing weaknesses
   - **Acceptable**: Adequate approach meeting requirements with offsetting strengths and weaknesses
   - **Marginal**: Approach with significant weaknesses that may be correctable
   - **Unacceptable**: Approach with deficiencies requiring major revision

2. **Three-Level Scale**
   - **Acceptable**: Meets requirements with acceptable risk
   - **Reasonably Susceptible to Being Made Acceptable**: Deficiencies that can be addressed
   - **Unacceptable**: Major deficiencies that cannot reasonably be corrected

3. **Risk Assessment Scale**
   - **Low Risk**: Little potential to disrupt schedule, performance, or cost
   - **Moderate Risk**: Some potential to disrupt schedule, performance, or cost
   - **High Risk**: Significant potential to disrupt schedule, performance, or cost

4. **Strengths-Weaknesses Scale (SWARD Analysis)**
   - **Strengths**: Aspects that exceed requirements or enhance performance
   - **Weaknesses**: Flaws that increase risk or reduce quality
   - **Risks**: Potential problems that may arise
   - **Deficiencies**: Failures to meet requirements

## Proposal Development Strategies Based on Evaluation Criteria

### General Strategies

1. **Alignment Strategy**
   - Explicitly align proposal structure with evaluation criteria
   - Use evaluation criteria language in headings and content
   - Create traceability matrices connecting proposal sections to criteria
   - Weight content according to relative importance of criteria

2. **Evidence Strategy**
   - Provide specific, relevant evidence for each evaluation factor
   - Include metrics, case studies, and past performance examples
   - Use graphics to highlight alignment with evaluation criteria
   - Anticipate and address potential weaknesses proactively

3. **Differentiation Strategy**
   - Identify your strongest areas relative to evaluation criteria
   - Emphasize unique capabilities that address specific criteria
   - Develop discriminators that relate directly to high-value criteria
   - Demonstrate direct relevance to the agency's mission and needs

## Conclusion

Understanding government evaluation criteria is critical to developing winning proposals. By aligning your response directly with these criteria and providing specific, compelling evidence of your capabilities, you can maximize your evaluation scores and increase your probability of success.
