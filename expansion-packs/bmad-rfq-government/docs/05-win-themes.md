# RFQ Expansion Pack: Win Themes

## Purpose of this Document

This document explains how to design and implement **Win Themes** as part of the RFQ Expansion Pack.  
Win themes are the **strategic backbone** of a proposal: they convey why your company is the **lowest risk, highest value, most customer-focused** choice.  
When paired with AI agents, win themes ensure proposal narratives are **consistent, persuasive, and tailored to the evaluator’s criteria**.

## What Are Win Themes?

A **Win Theme** is a persuasive message that connects:

- **Claim**: What you offer.
- **Proof**: Evidence (past performance, certifications, tools, people).
- **Benefit**: Why it matters to the customer.
- **Risk Reduction**: How it reduces mission or contract risk.

**Example**:  
_“CVP offers a proven USCIS modernization framework (Claim), backed by successful migration of 700+ apps to AWS (Proof), delivering faster time-to-value for USCIS programs (Benefit), while minimizing disruption through phased, risk-managed cutovers (Risk Reduction).”_

## Structure of a Strong Win Theme

1. **Customer-Centric** — directly tied to agency mission priorities.
2. **Evidence-Based** — includes concrete proof (metrics, case studies, past performance).
3. **Evaluator-Focused** — maps to Section M evaluation factors.
4. **Differentiated** — highlights what sets you apart from competitors.
5. **Repeatable** — can be reinforced across multiple sections of the proposal.

## Linking Win Themes to Evaluation Factors

Each **Evaluation Factor/Subfactor (Section M)** should have corresponding win themes.

**Example Mapping:**

- **Technical Approach →** Innovation, proven frameworks, risk mitigation.
- **Management Plan →** Agile, ISO-certified, staff retention rate.
- **Past Performance →** Similar scope/size/complexity, CPARS ratings.
- **Price →** Price realism, efficiency, cost avoidance.

This ensures evaluators see your discriminators **exactly where they are scoring.**

## AI Prompts for Drafting Differentiators

Win Theme Agent prompts should generate themes aligned to evaluation criteria.

**Example Prompt:**

```
From the attached RFQ Section M and our past performance corpus,
generate 3-5 win themes per evaluation factor.
Each theme must include: Claim, Proof, Benefit, Risk Reduction.
Ensure they are customer-centric and differentiated from typical competitor claims.
```

**Example Output (Technical Factor):**

1. _Proven modernization methodology (Claim), applied at USCIS SPEED program with zero downtime (Proof), ensures seamless transition (Benefit), reducing risk of mission disruption (Risk Reduction)._
2. _Certified agile teams (Claim), with 90%+ staff retention across DHS contracts (Proof), deliver continuity (Benefit), reducing re-training risk (Risk Reduction)._

## Checklist for Strong Win Themes

- [ ] Is the theme tied to a **customer mission priority**?
- [ ] Does it include **verifiable proof**?
- [ ] Is the **benefit clear to the agency**?
- [ ] Does it **differentiate us from competitors**?
- [ ] Can it be **woven across proposal sections** consistently?

## Summary

- Win themes are the **persuasive core** of RFQ proposals.
- Each theme must connect claim, proof, benefit, and risk reduction.
- Themes should be mapped to evaluation factors for maximum impact.
- AI agents can accelerate win theme drafting, but human capture managers refine them into **sharp discriminators**.
