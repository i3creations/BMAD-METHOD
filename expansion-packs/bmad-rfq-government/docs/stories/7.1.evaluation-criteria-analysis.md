  - [ ] Identify scoring thresholds and ranges
  - [ ] Create scoring simulation model
  - [ ] Document scoring rules and guidelines
- [ ] Implement historical comparison (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes

This story is part of the Strategy Development component and builds on the document analysis capabilities. The evaluation criteria analysis is critical for developing win strategies and ensuring proposal content addresses the most important factors.

The analysis should leverage the Section M Analyzer from the core components.

### Testing

- Test with various Section M formats to ensure robust extraction
- Verify weighting analysis provides useful insights
- Confirm scoring methodology identification is accurate
- Test historical comparison with past RFQs
- Validate recommendation quality with capture managers
