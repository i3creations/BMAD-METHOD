# Story 5.2: Document Structure Analysis

## Status

Draft

## Recommended Modes

- **Primary Mode**: üìä Business Analyst (bmad-analyst)
- **Secondary Mode**: üèóÔ∏è Architect (bmad-architect)

## Story

**As a** proposal team member,
**I want** the system to analyze the structure of RFQ documents,
**so that** I can quickly understand the organization and key sections.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Identification of key sections (L, M, SOW, etc.)
2. Creation of navigable document outline
3. Highlighting of critical sections
4. Summary report of document structure

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Develop section identification algorithm (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create patterns for recognizing standard RFQ sections
  - [ ] Implement section type classification
  - [ ] Handle variations in section naming conventions
  - [ ] Validate section identification accuracy
- [ ] Build document outline generator (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create hierarchical structure representation
  - [ ] Implement navigation links between sections
  - [ ] Generate table of contents
  - [ ] Ensure outline accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Implement critical section highlighting (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Define criteria for critical sections
  - [ ] Create visual indicators for important content
  - [ ] Allow customization of highlighting rules
  - [ ] Ensure highlighting is accessible and clear
- [ ] Create structure summary report (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Design report template
  - [ ] Include section distribution statistics
  - [ ] Provide complexity assessment
  - [ ] Generate recommendations for focus areas

## Dev Notes

This story builds on the RFQ Document Import functionality (Story 5.1) and provides the foundation for requirement extraction (Story 5.3). The document structure analysis is critical for understanding the organization and complexity of the RFQ.

The analysis should leverage VS Code extensions for document reading and context-aware analysis.

### Testing

- Test with various RFQ formats to ensure robust section identification
- Verify outline navigation works correctly
- Confirm critical section highlighting is accurate
- Validate structure summary report provides useful insights
