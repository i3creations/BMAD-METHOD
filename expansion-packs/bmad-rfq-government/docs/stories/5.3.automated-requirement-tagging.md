# Story 5.3: Automated Requirement Tagging

## Status

Draft

## Recommended Modes

- **Primary Mode**: üìù Product Owner (bmad-po)
- **Secondary Mode**: üíª Full Stack Developer (bmad-dev)

## Story

**As a** compliance manager,
**I want** the system to automatically tag requirements in RFQ documents,
**so that** I can ensure all requirements are identified and tracked.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Identification of explicit requirements (shall, must, will)
2. Identification of implicit requirements
3. Assignment of unique IDs to each requirement
4. Categorization by type (technical, management, etc.)
5. Ability to manually add or modify tags

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement explicit requirement detection (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create patterns for "shall," "must," "will" statements
  - [ ] Handle variations in requirement phrasing
  - [ ] Extract full requirement statements with context
  - [ ] Validate detection accuracy with sample RFQs
- [ ] Develop implicit requirement identification (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create algorithms for detecting implied requirements
  - [ ] Identify contextual requirements without explicit indicators
  - [ ] Implement confidence scoring for implicit requirements
  - [ ] Allow user verification of detected implicit requirements
- [ ] Build requirement ID assignment system (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create unique ID generation logic
  - [ ] Implement reference tracking between requirements
  - [ ] Ensure IDs are persistent across document updates
  - [ ] Create ID lookup and cross-reference capabilities
- [ ] Implement requirement categorization (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Define standard requirement categories
  - [ ] Create classification algorithm
  - [ ] Allow custom category creation
  - [ ] Implement category filtering and sorting
- [ ] Create manual tagging interface (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Design user interface for tag management
  - [ ] Implement tag addition functionality
  - [ ] Allow tag modification and deletion
  - [ ] Create bulk tagging capabilities

## Dev Notes

This story builds on the Document Structure Analysis (Story 5.2) and is a critical component for the Compliance Matrix Builder. The requirement tagging system is the foundation for ensuring proposal compliance.

The system should leverage AI-assisted requirement identification through VS Code extensions.

### Testing

- Test with various requirement phrasings to ensure robust detection
- Verify implicit requirement detection accuracy
- Confirm ID assignment is consistent and persistent
- Test categorization with different requirement types
- Validate manual tagging interface usability
