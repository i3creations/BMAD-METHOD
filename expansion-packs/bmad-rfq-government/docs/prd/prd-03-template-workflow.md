# Template and Workflow Design

## Overall Approach

The RFQ Expansion Pack will provide a structured set of markdown and YAML templates that guide proposal teams through the RFQ response process. The templates will emphasize compliance tracking, content generation, and review workflows, with clear organization of proposal components and quality metrics. The templates will be designed for proposal professionals who may not have specialized AI knowledge, focusing on familiar proposal terminology and processes.
