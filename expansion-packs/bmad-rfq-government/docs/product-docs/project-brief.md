# Project Brief: BMAD RFQ Expansion Pack

## Executive Summary

The RFQ Expansion Pack extends the BMAD Method into the domain of government contracting proposal development, specifically for Requests for Quotes (RFQs). It provides a structured approach to AI-driven proposal generation that aligns with BMAD's modular design. The expansion pack empowers capture teams, proposal managers, and subject matter experts to rapidly create compliant, competitive, and compelling proposals while maintaining the rigor and discipline required in federal contracting.

The pack addresses the resource-intensive process of responding to RFQs with strict requirements by leveraging AI to accelerate draft creation, ensure compliance traceability, standardize outputs, and reduce costs associated with repetitive drafting tasks.

## Problem Statement

Responding to government RFQs is a resource-intensive process that presents several challenges:

- **Time pressure**: RFQ deadlines are often short, typically less than 14 days, creating significant pressure on proposal teams.
- **Volume of content**: RFQs require extensive documentation including technical approaches, management plans, past performance narratives, and pricing justifications.
- **Complexity of compliance requirements**: Agencies require strict adherence to Section L (Instructions) and Section M (Evaluation Criteria), detailed compliance matrices, and specific formatting and submission rules.
- **Consistency challenges**: Maintaining consistency across multiple proposals and ensuring all requirements are addressed is difficult with manual processes.
- **Risk of rejection**: Missing even one requirement can result in a "non-compliant" rating and automatic rejection, regardless of the proposal's quality.

Current manual processes are slow, error-prone, and struggle to scale when multiple RFQs need responses simultaneously. Organizations need a more efficient, reliable approach to proposal development that maintains quality while reducing resource requirements.

## Proposed Solution

The RFQ Expansion Pack leverages BMAD's role-based orchestration model to create an AI-driven proposal generation system with the following components:

- **Domain-specific roles**: Mapping BMAD roles to RFQ process functions (Capture Manager, Proposal Manager, Technical SME, etc.)
- **AI agent configurations**: Specialized agents that simulate proposal roles (Compliance Matrix Builder, Win Theme Generator, Technical Narrative Drafter, etc.)
- **Prompt libraries and workflows**: Tailored to RFQ lifecycle stages from opportunity identification to submission
- **Templates and tools**: For compliance matrices, proposal sections, and submission checklists
- **Data ingestion framework**: Leveraging BMAD's Flattener Tool to process RFQ documents and corporate assets

The solution ensures proposals are:

- **Compliant**: Automatically mapping RFQ requirements into response structures
- **Consistent**: Applying standardized templates, tone, and win themes
- **Competitive**: Highlighting differentiators and addressing evaluation criteria
- **Efficient**: Drafting compliant proposal volumes within hours instead of days or weeks

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Proposal Teams

- **Demographics**: Government contractors (both primes and subs) responding to federal RFQs
- **Current behaviors**: Manual extraction of requirements, labor-intensive drafting, time-consuming reviews
- **Pain points**: Short deadlines, complex compliance requirements, resource constraints
- **Goals**: Win more contracts, reduce proposal costs, maintain compliance, scale proposal operations

### Secondary User Segment: Business Development & Executives

- **Demographics**: Capture managers, business developers, and executives who sponsor bids
- **Current behaviors**: Qualifying opportunities, developing win strategies, approving proposals
- **Pain points**: Limited visibility into proposal progress, difficulty ensuring win themes are incorporated
- **Goals**: Improve win rates, make data-driven bid decisions, ensure strategic alignment

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives

- Reduce proposal development time by 50% compared to manual methods
- Increase proposal throughput (number of RFQs responded to) by 30% with the same team size
- Improve win rate by ensuring 100% compliance with RFQ requirements
- Decrease labor costs associated with proposal development by 40%

### User Success Metrics

- Proposal managers complete compliance matrices in hours instead of days
- Technical SMEs focus on solution refinement rather than initial drafting
- Review teams identify fewer compliance issues in early drafts
- Executives gain clearer visibility into proposal quality and readiness

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Compliance rate**: 100% of requirements mapped and addressed in proposals
- **Draft generation time**: <48 hours for first complete draft of all volumes
- **Review efficiency**: Reduction in number of review cycles needed before submission
- **Win rate**: Percentage increase in successful proposals after implementation

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **Role-based AI agents**: Configured agents for key proposal roles (Proposal Manager, Technical SME, etc.)
- **Compliance Matrix Builder**: Automated extraction of requirements from RFQ documents
- **Win Theme Generator**: AI-assisted development of discriminators and win strategies
- **Proposal Drafting System**: Section-specific prompt templates for generating narrative content
- **Review Simulation**: AI-driven evaluation against Section M criteria
- **Submission Checklist**: Automated verification of formatting and compliance requirements

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Integration with GovWin/GovTribe APIs for pipeline intelligence
- Fine-tuned LLMs on past proposal language
- Orals/Slides Generator for presentations
- Automated pricing calculations (pricing narrative support only)

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when it demonstrates:

1. Complete end-to-end proposal generation for a standard RFQ
2. 100% compliance with requirements in the generated proposal
3. 50% reduction in time to first draft compared to manual methods
4. Positive feedback from proposal teams on quality and usability

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features

- **Resume Tailoring Agent**: Auto-align resumes with RFQ Key Personnel criteria
- **Auto-Amendment Diff Checker**: Highlight impacts of RFQ changes in real-time
- **Competitor Analysis Tool**: AI-driven analysis of competitor strengths and weaknesses
- **Enhanced Review Simulation**: More sophisticated evaluation algorithms based on historical data

### Long-term Vision

Within 1-2 years, the RFQ Expansion Pack will evolve into a comprehensive proposal lifecycle management system that:

- Integrates with opportunity identification and pipeline management
- Provides predictive win probability based on proposal content and competitive analysis
- Offers continuous learning from win/loss data to refine prompts and templates
- Supports multiple proposal types beyond RFQs (RFPs, RFIs, etc.)

### Expansion Opportunities

- Extend to state and local government procurement processes
- Adapt for commercial proposal responses
- Create industry-specific versions (healthcare, defense, IT services)

- RFQ documents can be converted to machine-readable formats
- Human validation will remain necessary for technical accuracy and final submissions
- The system will complement, not replace, proposal professionals
- BMAD's core capabilities can be adapted to proposal-specific workflows

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Data security**: Handling of sensitive pricing and proprietary information requires careful controls
- **User adoption**: Proposal teams may resist AI-driven approaches due to traditional practices
- **Quality consistency**: Ensuring consistent quality across all proposal sections and volumes

### Open Questions

- How will the system handle highly specialized or technical RFQs?
- What level of customization will be needed for different agencies or contract vehicles?
- How can we measure improvement in win rates attributable to the expansion pack?
- What is the optimal balance between AI generation and human refinement?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Best practices for fine-tuning LLMs on proposal language
- Compliance requirements for AI use in government contracting
- Integration possibilities with existing proposal management software
- Methods for quantifying proposal quality and competitiveness
