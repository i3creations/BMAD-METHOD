# RFQ Expansion Pack: Proposal Drafting

## Purpose of this Document

This document describes how to use the RFQ Expansion Pack to **generate proposal narratives**.  
Proposal drafting is the most **labor-intensive part** of the RFQ process.  
By leveraging AI, we can accelerate the creation of:

- Executive Summary
- Technical Approach
- Management Plan
- Staffing & Key Personnel
- Past Performance Narratives

The Expansion Pack ensures drafts are **compliant, persuasive, and aligned with win themes**.

## Drafting Major Proposal Sections

### Executive Summary

- **Purpose**: Provide a high-level case for selection.
- **Content**: Mission understanding, win themes, unique value, risk reduction.
- **AI Prompts**:

```
Generate a 2-page executive summary tailored for [Agency].
Include mission understanding, 3-4 win themes, and a strong value proposition.
Tone should be customer-centric and persuasive.
```

### Technical Approach

- **Purpose**: Demonstrate how requirements will be met/exceeded.
- **Content**: Methodologies, tools, innovations, risk mitigation.
- **AI Prompts**:

```
Write a 3-5 page Technical Approach mapped to the SOW tasks.
Use past performance corpus for evidence.
Highlight innovation, risk management, and compliance with Section M evaluation factors.
```

### Management Plan

- **Purpose**: Show the agency you can manage people, risks, and processes.
- **Content**: Organization structure, reporting, quality assurance, communication.
- **AI Prompts**:

```
Draft a Management Plan including org chart, staffing approach, risk management,
and communication processes. Map each element to relevant Section M criteria.
```

### Staffing & Key Personnel

- **Purpose**: Demonstrate qualified staff who meet/exceed requirements.
- **Content**: Key personnel bios, resumes, staffing plan, retention strategies.
- **AI Prompts**:

```
Using provided resumes and Key Personnel requirements,
generate tailored bios that highlight certifications, DHS/DoD experience,
and relevance to RFQ-required positions.
```

### Past Performance Narratives

- **Purpose**: Provide proof of success on similar projects.
- **Content**: Scope, size, complexity, relevance, customer satisfaction.
- **AI Prompts**:

```
From the past performance library, generate narratives for 3 relevant contracts.
Each should include customer, scope, size, complexity, period of performance,
and outcomes. Emphasize how they reduce risk for this RFQ.
```

## Prompt Templates for Drafting

Each section should have **customizable prompt templates**.  
Templates can include placeholders:

- `[Agency]`
- `[SOW Tasks]`
- `[Evaluation Factors]`
- `[Past Performance IDs]`
- `[Key Personnel]`

This allows **reusable, repeatable drafting workflows**.

---

## Integrating Compliance Matrix & Win Themes

- **Compliance Matrix Integration**: Ensure every requirement ID (R-001, R-002, …) is covered in proposal text.
- **Win Themes Integration**: Each section should reinforce win themes (at least one per major section).
- **Traceability**: Insert requirement IDs as comments or footnotes for internal tracking.

**Example:**  
“In alignment with R-002, our team will provide on-site training using certified instructors, reducing ramp-up risk (Win Theme #2).”

---

## Example Drafting Workflow

1. **Load Corpus**: RFQ text, compliance matrix, past performance library.
2. **Generate Section Drafts**: Use section-specific prompt templates.
3. **Insert Win Themes**: AI highlights where themes should appear.
4. **Human Review**: SMEs refine content for accuracy.
5. **Review-Sim Pass**: AI evaluates draft against Section M.
6. **Finalize**: Content locked, style/formatting check.

## Summary

- Proposal drafting is streamlined with AI prompts and templates.
- Each major section has unique requirements and prompt strategies.
- Compliance matrix and win themes ensure traceability and persuasiveness.
- The workflow balances **AI speed** with **human refinement** for a winning proposal.
