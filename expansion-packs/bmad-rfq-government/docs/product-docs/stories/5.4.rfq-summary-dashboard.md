## Status

Draft

## Recommended Modes

- **Primary Mode**: ðŸ“‹ Product Manager (bmad-pm)
- **Secondary Mode**: ðŸŽ¨ UX Expert (bmad-ux-expert)

## Story

**As an** executive,
**I want** a dashboard summarizing key RFQ information,
**so that** I can quickly understand the opportunity and make bid decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Display of key metadata (value, duration, agency)
2. Summary of requirement count by category
3. Timeline visualization with key dates
4. Initial assessment of complexity and effort
5. Preliminary win probability estimate

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create metadata display component (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Design metadata visualization layout
  - [ ] Implement data extraction from RFQ documents
  - [ ] Create formatting for different metadata types
  - [ ] Ensure critical information is prominently displayed
- [ ] Build requirement summary visualization (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create category-based requirement grouping
  - [ ] Implement count visualization (charts, graphs)
  - [ ] Add filtering capabilities by requirement type
  - [ ] Include compliance status indicators
- [ ] Develop timeline visualization (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create interactive timeline component
  - [ ] Extract and display key dates from RFQ
  - [ ] Implement milestone creation and tracking
  - [ ] Add deadline warnings and notifications
- [ ] Implement complexity assessment (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Define complexity scoring algorithm
  - [ ] Create effort estimation model
  - [ ] Visualize complexity factors
  - [ ] Allow manual adjustment of complexity ratings
- [ ] Create win probability estimator (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Define probability calculation factors
  - [ ] Implement scoring algorithm
  - [ ] Create visual representation of win probability
  - [ ] Allow input of competitive factors

## Dev Notes

This story builds on the previous document analysis and requirement tagging stories (5.1-5.3) and provides executive-level insights for bid decision-making. The dashboard should be designed for clarity and quick understanding of the opportunity.

The dashboard should integrate with the RFQ Analysis Template from the core components.

### Testing

- Test with various RFQ types to ensure robust data extraction
- Verify timeline visualization accuracy
- Confirm complexity assessment provides useful insights
- Validate win probability estimation with historical data
- Test dashboard usability with executive users
