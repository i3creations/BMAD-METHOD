## Business Value

**Priority**: High (Must have)

This story provides the foundation for the entire RFQ analysis process. Without the ability to import and process RFQ documents, the system cannot perform its core functions of analyzing requirements and assisting with proposal development.

**Value Proposition**:

- Reduces manual document handling time by approximately 60%
- Enables faster identification of key RFQ elements
- Provides consistent organization of RFQ materials
- Serves as the entry point for all AI-assisted analysis

## Dependencies

- **Depends on**:
  - Story 1.3: User Authentication and Permissions (for secure document handling)
  - Story 3.2: File Storage System Implementation (for document storage)

- **Blocks**:
  - Story 5.2: Document Text Extraction
  - Story 5.3: RFQ Requirement Identification
  - Story 6.1: Proposal Template Generation

## Dev Notes

This story is part of Epic 5: Document Processing and Analysis, which focuses on the initial processing of RFQ documents. The document import functionality is the foundation for all subsequent RFQ analysis and proposal development activities.

Integration with VS Code extensions is critical for this story, as the documents need to be accessible by AI agents for analysis.

### Technical Considerations

- Document parsing libraries should be evaluated for accuracy and performance:
  - PDF.js or PyPDF2 for PDF documents
  - Mammoth or docx for DOCX files
  - Consider Tesseract for OCR capabilities
  - Benchmark each library with sample RFQ documents before final selection

- Storage considerations:
  - Estimate 50-100MB average storage per RFQ
  - Implement compression for long-term storage
  - Consider versioning for document updates
  - Plan for 30% annual growth in document storage requirements
  - Implement tiered storage strategy (hot/cold) based on document age

- Security requirements:
  - Documents must be encrypted at rest
  - Access control based on user roles and project assignments
  - Audit logging for all document access and modifications
  - Implement document watermarking for sensitive RFQs
  - Support for document expiration and automatic archiving

- Integration architecture:
  - Define REST API endpoints for document operations
  - Implement webhook notifications for document processing events
  - Create service interfaces for AI agent interaction with documents

  - Multi-file selection capability
  - Progress indicators for large document imports
  - Clear error messages that suggest resolution steps
  - Preview capability before finalizing import
  - Bulk action capabilities for multiple documents
  - Sorting and filtering options for document lists

- Accessibility requirements:
  - Interface must be keyboard navigable
  - All notifications must be screen reader compatible
  - Color coding must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
  - Support for screen magnification and text scaling
  - Keyboard shortcuts for common operations

- User workflow integration:
  - Seamless transition from import to document analysis
  - Integration with user dashboard for import status monitoring
  - Notification system for completed imports and processing
