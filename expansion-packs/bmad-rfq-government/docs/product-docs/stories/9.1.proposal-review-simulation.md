- **Primary Mode**: üß™ Test Architect & Quality Advisor (bmad-qa)
- **Secondary Mode**: üèÉ Scrum Master (bmad-sm)

## Story

**As a** proposal manager,
**I want** to simulate how evaluators will review our proposal,
**so that** I can identify and address weaknesses before submission.

1. Evaluation against Section M criteria
2. Scoring simulation
3. Identification of strengths and weaknesses
4. Recommendations for improvement
5. Comparison to compliance requirements

## Dev Notes

This story is part of the Review & Quality Control component and builds on the previous stories for compliance management and content generation. The review simulation is critical for improving proposal quality before submission.

The review simulation should leverage the Evaluation Simulator from the core components.

### Testing

- Test evaluation against various Section M formats
- Verify scoring simulation accuracy
- Confirm strength/weakness identification is insightful
- Test recommendation quality and relevance
- Validate compliance comparison thoroughness
