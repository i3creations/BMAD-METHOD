# RFQ Expansion Pack: Introduction

## Purpose of this Document

This document introduces the RFQ Expansion Pack for the BMAD Method.  
It explains the motivation, scope, and benefits of extending BMAD into the domain of **government contracting proposal development**, specifically for **Requests for Quotes (RFQs)**.

The RFQ Expansion Pack provides a structured approach to **AI-driven proposal generation** that aligns with BMAD’s modular design. It empowers capture teams, proposal managers, and subject matter experts to rapidly create **compliant, competitive, and compelling** proposals while maintaining the rigor and discipline required in federal contracting.

## Why Create an RFQ Expansion Pack?

Responding to RFQs is a **resource-intensive process**. Agencies typically require:

- Strict adherence to **Section L (Instructions)** and **Section M (Evaluation Criteria)**
- Detailed compliance matrices
- Technical, management, staffing, and past performance narratives
- Pricing narratives and assumptions
- Formatting and submission compliance

Proposal teams often struggle with:

- **Time pressure** (short RFQ deadlines, often < 14 days)
- **Volume of content** to generate
- **Complexity of compliance requirements**
- **Consistency** across multiple proposals

By leveraging AI within a BMAD expansion pack, organizations can:

- **Accelerate draft creation** (hours instead of days or weeks)
- **Ensure compliance traceability** from requirements to response
- **Standardize outputs** across proposals
- **Reduce costs** by cutting labor hours spent on repetitive drafting

## Benefits of AI-Driven Proposal Generation

- **Speed**: Draft compliant proposal volumes within hours.
- **Consistency**: Apply standardized templates, tone, and win themes.
- **Compliance**: Automatically map RFQ requirements into response structures.
- **Insight**: Simulate evaluator scoring and highlight weaknesses early.
- **Scalability**: Support multiple simultaneous RFQs without overloading proposal teams.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from debriefs and refine prompts/templates over time.

## How This Fits into BMAD Expansion Packs

The RFQ Expansion Pack builds on BMAD’s **role-based orchestration**.  
Just as BMAD includes packs for **game development, data science, and DevOps**, the RFQ Expansion Pack:

- Introduces **domain-specific roles** (Capture Manager, Proposal Manager, Compliance Agent, etc.)
- Provides **AI agent configurations** that simulate those roles
- Includes **prompt libraries** and **workflow pipelines** tailored to RFQ lifecycle stages
- Supplies **templates** for compliance matrices, proposal sections, and checklists
- Leverages BMAD’s **Flattener Tool** to ingest past performance libraries, resumes, and RFQ attachments

This ensures the RFQ process is **plug-and-play** with the BMAD ecosystem.

## Audience and Intended Users

- **Government Contractors** (both primes and subs)
- **Proposal & Capture Teams** (managers, writers, reviewers, SMEs)
- **Business Developers** (identifying and qualifying opportunities)
- **Executives** (sponsoring bids and approving themes)
- **AI/Automation Engineers** (implementing and tuning the pack within BMAD)

## Structure of the Documentation Set

The RFQ Expansion Pack documentation is divided into 10 parts:

1. **Introduction** (this document)
2. **Roles** — Mapping BMAD roles to RFQ functions
3. **Data Ingestion** — Preparing RFQ and corporate data for AI
4. **Compliance Matrix** — Building and managing compliance traceability
5. **Win Themes** — Developing discriminators and win strategies
6. **Proposal Drafting** — Generating proposal narratives with AI
7. **Pricing Support** — AI assistance for pricing volumes and narratives
8. **Review Simulation** — Simulating evaluator reviews for quality control
9. **Submission Checklist** — Ensuring formatting and compliance readiness
10. **Continuous Improvement** — Lessons learned and versioning

Together, these components provide a **complete playbook** for building and maintaining a robust RFQ Expansion Pack inside BMAD.
