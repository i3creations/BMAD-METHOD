# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Create a comprehensive AI-driven proposal generation system for government RFQs
- Reduce proposal development time by 50% compared to manual methods
- Ensure 100% compliance with RFQ requirements through automated extraction and mapping
- Increase proposal throughput by 30% with the same team size
- Improve win rates through consistent quality and strategic alignment
- Decrease labor costs associated with proposal development by 40%

## Background Context

Government contractors face significant challenges when responding to Requests for Quotes (RFQs), including tight deadlines (typically less than 14 days), extensive documentation requirements, and strict compliance standards. Current manual processes are slow, error-prone, and struggle to scale when multiple RFQs need responses simultaneously. The RFQ Expansion Pack extends the BMAD Method into the domain of government contracting proposal development, providing a structured approach to AI-driven proposal generation that maintains the rigor and discipline required in federal contracting.
