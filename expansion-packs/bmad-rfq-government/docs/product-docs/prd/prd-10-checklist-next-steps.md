# Checklist Results Report

The PRD has been developed based on the project brief and follows the BMAD Method's PRD template structure. The document includes:

- Clear goals and background context
- Comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements
- Template and workflow design
- Technical assumptions
- Structured epics and stories with acceptance criteria

The PRD addresses all key aspects of the RFQ Expansion Pack, including:

- RFQ document processing and requirement extraction
- Compliance matrix building and win theme generation
- Content generation and templating
- Review simulation and submission preparation

## Next Steps

### Architect Prompt

Develop the technical architecture for the BMAD RFQ Government Expansion Pack based on this PRD. Focus on integration with BMAD core components, the template structure, and the agent orchestration system for proposal generation. Ensure the architecture supports secure handling of sensitive proposal information and scalability for processing large RFQ documents. Define the YAML and markdown template structures needed for each component of the proposal process.
