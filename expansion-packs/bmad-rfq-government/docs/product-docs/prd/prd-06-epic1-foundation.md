# Epic 1: Foundation & RFQ Analysis

Establish the core infrastructure for the RFQ Expansion Pack and implement the fundamental capability to process RFQ documents and extract requirements. This epic delivers the foundation for all subsequent proposal development activities by creating a structured representation of the RFQ that can drive compliance and content generation.

## Story 1.1 Project Setup and Integration

As a developer,
I want to set up the expansion pack structure and integrate with BMAD core,
so that we have a solid foundation for development.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Repository structure follows BMAD expansion pack conventions
2: Core configuration files are properly set up
3: Integration with BMAD agent orchestration system is established
4: Basic CI/CD pipeline is configured
5: Development environment is documented

## Story 1.2 RFQ Document Processor

As a proposal manager,
I want to organize RFQ documents in a project folder accessible by VS Code extensions,
so that AI assistants can read and analyze the documents for proposal development.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Clear folder structure for RFQ document organization
2: Documents are accessible by VS Code extensions (Roo Code, Cline, Claude)
3: Document structure (sections, subsections) remains readable by extensions
4: Integration with VS Code extension capabilities is documented
5: Guidelines for document organization are provided to users

## Story 1.3 Requirement Extraction Engine

As a compliance manager,
I want the system to automatically identify and extract requirements from RFQ documents,
so that I can ensure all requirements are addressed in the proposal.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: System identifies "shall," "must," "will," and other requirement indicators
2: Requirements are extracted with their context and reference information
3: Requirements are categorized by type (technical, management, past performance, etc.)
4: Extraction accuracy is validated against manual identification
5: Users can review and adjust extracted requirements if needed

## Story 1.4 RFQ Analysis Template

As a proposal team member,
I want a structured template for RFQ analysis,
so that I can understand the scope and complexity of the response effort.

### Acceptance Criteria

1: Template includes fields for key RFQ metadata (agency, due date, contract value, etc.)
2: Format supports summary statistics of extracted requirements
3: Structure for complexity assessment is provided
4: Critical dates and deadlines are highlighted in the template
5: Organization facilitates navigation to detailed sections
