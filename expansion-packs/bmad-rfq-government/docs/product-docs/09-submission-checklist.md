# RFQ Expansion Pack: Submission Checklist

## Purpose of this Document

This document provides detailed guidance on creating a **submission-ready proposal package**.  
Even the strongest technical and management proposals can be **rejected outright** if submission instructions are not followed.  
The RFQ Expansion Pack includes AI-driven tools to enforce compliance with formatting, packaging, and delivery requirements.

## Formatting & Compliance Requirements

Most RFQs specify strict formatting rules in **Section L**:

- Page limits (e.g., 25 pages for technical volume)
- Fonts and sizes (e.g., Times New Roman 12pt)
- Margins and line spacing
- File formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX)
- File naming conventions
- Delivery instructions (email, portal, hard copy)

**AI Agent Tasks**:

- Scan draft documents for formatting compliance
- Flag violations (font size, page count, margin size)
- Verify file types and sizes

**Example Prompt**:

```
Check the attached proposal draft against Section L formatting requirements.
List all violations (font, page limit, margins, file type).
```

## AI White Glove Compliance Check

Before final submission, the **White Glove agent** runs a comprehensive audit:

1. Validate compliance matrix coverage.
2. Confirm that each requirement is addressed in the proposal.
3. Check formatting, pagination, and section labeling.
4. Verify document headers/footers include RFQ number and company name.
5. Ensure acronyms are defined at first use.

**Example Output**:

- ❌ Technical Volume exceeds page limit by 2 pages.
- ❌ Missing RFQ number in footer.
- ✅ All requirements from compliance matrix are addressed.

/final/
Technical_Volume.pdf
Management_Volume.pdf
Past_Performance.pdf
Cost_Volume.xlsx
Compliance_Matrix.xlsx
/supporting/
resumes/
past_performance/
assumptions/
```

**Naming Conventions**:

- `[RFQ Number]_[Volume]_[Company].ext`
