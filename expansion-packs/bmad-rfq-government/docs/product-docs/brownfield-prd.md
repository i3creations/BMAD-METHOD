# BMAD RFQ Government Expansion Pack Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Create a comprehensive AI-driven proposal generation system for government RFQs
- Reduce proposal development time by 50% compared to manual methods
- Ensure 100% compliance with RFQ requirements through automated extraction and mapping
- Increase proposal throughput by 30% with the same team size
- Improve win rates through consistent quality and strategic alignment
- Decrease labor costs associated with proposal development by 40%

### Background Context

Government contractors face significant challenges when responding to Requests for Quotes (RFQs), including tight deadlines (typically less than 14 days), extensive documentation requirements, and strict compliance standards. Current manual processes are slow, error-prone, and struggle to scale when multiple RFQs need responses simultaneously. The RFQ Expansion Pack extends the BMAD Method into the domain of government contracting proposal development, providing a structured approach to AI-driven proposal generation that maintains the rigor and discipline required in federal contracting.

## Template and Workflow Design

### Overall Approach

The RFQ Expansion Pack will provide a structured set of markdown and YAML templates that guide proposal teams through the RFQ response process. The templates will emphasize compliance tracking, content generation, and review workflows, with clear organization of proposal components and quality metrics. The templates will be designed for proposal professionals who may not have specialized AI knowledge, focusing on familiar proposal terminology and processes.

### Key Workflow Components

- **Guided Processes**: Step-by-step workflows aligned with proposal development lifecycle
- **Compliance Tracking**: Structured templates for requirement coverage and compliance status
- **Collaborative Review**: Templates supporting AI and human collaboration on content
- **Progress Monitoring**: Checklists for proposal status, deadlines, and quality metrics
- **Content Generation**: Specialized prompts for narrative development

### Core Template Types

- **RFQ Analysis Template**: Structure for extracted requirements, compliance status, and key dates
- **Compliance Matrix Template**: Format for mapping requirements to proposal sections
- **Win Theme Template**: Structure for developing and applying strategic themes
- **Content Generation Templates**: Section-specific templates with prompts for narrative content
- **Review Checklist**: Evaluation criteria based on Section M
- **Submission Checklist**: Verification of all compliance requirements

## Technical Assumptions
