    - labor-mapping-assistant

  guidance: >-
    This team works best when RFQ documents are available for analysis. Start with the
    opportunity summarizer agent to qualify the opportunity, then use the win theme
    generator to develop discriminators before moving to compliance tracking and content
    development. Use the evaluator simulator for proposal review before finalizing.
