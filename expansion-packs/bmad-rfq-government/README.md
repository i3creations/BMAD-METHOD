## Overview

The BMAD RFQ Government Response Pack is a specialized expansion pack for the BMAD Method focused on government RFQ (Request for Quote) response and proposal development. It provides a structured approach to AI-driven proposal generation that empowers capture teams, proposal managers, and subject matter experts to rapidly create **compliant, competitive, and compelling** proposals while maintaining the rigor and discipline required in federal contracting.

This expansion pack leverages the BMAD Method's role-based orchestration to streamline the complex process of responding to government solicitations, particularly focusing on:

- **Proposal compliance** with Section L (Instructions) and Section M (Evaluation Criteria)
- **Win theme development** and competitive positioning
- **Technical and management narrative creation**
- **Price/cost strategy and justification**
- **Proposal review and evaluation simulation**

## Key Benefits

- **Speed**: Draft compliant proposal volumes within hours instead of days or weeks
- **Consistency**: Apply standardized templates, tone, and win themes across all proposal sections
- **Compliance**: Automatically map RFQ requirements into structured response matrices
- **Insight**: Simulate evaluator scoring and highlight weaknesses before submission
- **Scalability**: Support multiple simultaneous RFQ responses without overloading proposal teams
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from debriefs and refine templates/workflows over time
