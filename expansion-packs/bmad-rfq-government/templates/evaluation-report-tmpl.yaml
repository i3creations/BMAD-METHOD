    content: |
      - **Evaluator Mindset**: Review from the perspective of government evaluators, not proposal authors
      - **Criteria Focus**: Base all evaluations strictly on Section M criteria
      - **Evidence-Based**: Provide specific examples for all findings
      - **Constructive Approach**: Frame weaknesses with actionable improvement recommendations
      - **Prioritized Feedback**: Focus on highest-impact improvements first
      - **Objective Assessment**: Evaluate based on what's actually in the proposal, not what authors intended
      - **Comprehensive Coverage**: Review all sections against all applicable criteria
      - **Documentation Discipline**: Maintain detailed records of all findings and recommendations
