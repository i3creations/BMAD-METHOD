Built on our proven HealthConnect framework—currently serving 12 federal healthcare agencies—VetSchedule seamlessly integrates with the VA's existing VistA infrastructure while providing a modern, mobile-friendly interface for both veterans and providers.

      By implementing VetSchedule, the VA will achieve its strategic goals of improving veteran satisfaction, increasing care accessibility, and optimizing resource utilization across all 1,255 VA healthcare facilities.
