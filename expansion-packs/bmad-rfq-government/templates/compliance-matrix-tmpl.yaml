    title: Organization Guidelines
    content: |
      1. **Group by RFQ Section**:
         - Organize requirements by RFQ section (L.1, L.2, M.1, etc.)
         - Use clear section headers to separate groups

      2. **Alternate Organization**:
         - Can be reorganized by proposal volume/section
         - Include cross-references to original RFQ sections

      3. **Hierarchical Structure**:
         - Use indentation or numbering for nested requirements
         - Maintain parent-child relationships

      4. **Visual Distinction**:
         - Use color coding for different requirement types
         - Highlight critical requirements

  - id: best-practices
    title: Best Practices
    content: |
      - **Complete Coverage**: Ensure every requirement is captured, no matter how minor
      - **Atomic Requirements**: Break compound requirements into discrete, trackable items
      - **Verbatim Extraction**: Use exact requirement language from the RFQ
      - **Clear Ownership**: Assign specific owners to each requirement
      - **Strategic Organization**: Organize requirements to facilitate efficient response development
      - **Regular Updates**: Maintain the matrix as a living document throughout proposal development
      - **Multiple Validations**: Conduct independent reviews to verify completeness
      - **Visual Indicators**: Use color coding or icons to highlight status and priority
